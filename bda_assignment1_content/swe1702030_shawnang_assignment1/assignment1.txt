b. Count the number of occurrences of each word in the file. The count should be
case-insensitive and ignore punctuations. (20 marks)
c. Based on b, count the number of occurrences of 2-gram in the file. A 2-gram is a
sequence that contains the adjacent two words. For example, the 2-gram in the

d. Based on b, obtain the top 20 most frequently occurred words except the stop words
such as “a”, “the”, “this” and so on. The stop words can be imported by stop-words
package (see https://pypi.org/project/stop-words/) (Hint: use 2 steps and the second
